# Angularapp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.0.

## Development server
To run locally, it is a must that you are running node v16 and nothing later (errors were encountered using node v18). Next, change the clientID and clientSecret values in the environment.development.ts file to what you have on your reddit dev console. Next place the angularapp subfolder found in this repo in the reddit-poller project directory (found in this repo: https://github.com/NRunks/reddit-poller) alongside the webapi folder. Follow the rest of the instructions here: https://github.com/NRunks/reddit-poller
